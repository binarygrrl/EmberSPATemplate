# Ember SPA Template

This template is inspired by the [MVCSPAWithEmberJS project](https://github.com/xqiu/MVCSPAWithEmberjs). That project requires .NET 4.5 and VS2012.  I recommend using it if you can meet those requirements.

This project also includes the nuget packages within the VSIX when built to facilitate easier setup at the expense of disk space.
